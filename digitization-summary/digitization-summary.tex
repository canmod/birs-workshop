  In addition to funding research, training, and networking opportunities for building applied infectious disease modelling capacity in Canada, CANMOD also funded a project to provide straightforward and convenient access to historical and publicly available incidence, mortality, and population data. This project led to three long-term Canadian datasets.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Notifiable Communicable Disease Incidence (CDI) (1924-2000)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 1924-1980 (weekly), 1980-1990 (monthly), 1990-2000 (quarterly)
      \item Broken down by province/territory
      \item Broken down by disease
      \item Some diseases broken down by age and sex (before 1956)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Mortality (1950-2010)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Weekly
      \item Broken down by province/territory
      \item Broken down by 12 StatCan-selected cause groups
      \item Extends StatCan public data portal back from 2010 to 1950
    \end{itemize}
  \item Population (1871-present)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Population estimates every ten years (1881-1921), every year (1921-present)
      \item Broken down by sex
      \item Broken down by age
      \item Broken down by province/territory
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
